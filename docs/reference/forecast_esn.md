# Forecast an Echo State Network

Forecast an Echo State Network (ESN) from a trained model via recursive
forecasting. Forecast intervals are generated by simulating future
sample path based on a moving block bootstrap of the residuals and
estimating the quantiles from the simulations.

## Usage

``` r
forecast_esn(
  object,
  n_ahead = 18,
  levels = c(80, 95),
  n_sim = 100,
  n_seed = 42
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An object of class `esn`. The result of a call to
  [`train_esn()`](https://ahaeusser.github.io/echos/reference/train_esn.md).

- n_ahead:

  Integer value. The number of periods for forecasting (i.e. forecast
  horizon).

- levels:

  Integer vector. The levels of the forecast intervals, e.g., 80% and
  95%.

- n_sim:

  Integer value. The number of future sample path generated during
  simulation.

- n_seed:

  Integer value. The seed for the random number generator (for
  reproducibility).

## Value

A `list` containing:

- `point`: Numeric vector containing the point forecasts.

- `interval`: Numeric matrix containing the forecast intervals.

- `sim`: Numeric matrix containing the simulated future sample path.

- `levels`: Integer vector. The levels of the forecast intervals.

- `actual`: Numeric vector containing the actual values.

- `fitted`: Numeric vector containing the fitted values.

- `n_ahead`: Integer value. The number of periods for forecasting
  (forecast horizon).

- `model_spec`: Character value. The model specification as string.

## Examples

``` r
xdata <- as.numeric(AirPassengers)
xmodel <- train_esn(y = xdata)
xfcst <- forecast_esn(xmodel, n_ahead = 12)
plot(xfcst)
```
