# Changelog

## echos 1.0.2

CRAN release: 2025-06-23

### New features

- Added forecast intervals to
  [`forecast_esn()`](https://ahaeusser.github.io/echos/reference/forecast_esn.md),
  [`forecast.ESN()`](https://ahaeusser.github.io/echos/reference/forecast.ESN.md)
  and
  [`plot.forecast_esn()`](https://ahaeusser.github.io/echos/reference/plot.forecast_esn.md).
  Forecast intervals are generated by simulating future sample path
  based on a moving block bootstrap of the residuals and estimating the
  quantiles from the simulations.
- Added
  [`plot.esn()`](https://ahaeusser.github.io/echos/reference/plot.esn.md)
  to visualize the internal states (i.e., the reservoir).
- Added
  [`filter_esn()`](https://ahaeusser.github.io/echos/reference/filter_esn.md)
  to extract ESN models from a mable.
- Added `synthetic_data`, a dataset with synthetic time series data as
  tibble.
