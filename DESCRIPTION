Title: Echo State Networks for Time Series Forecasting
Version: 0.0.1
Description: This package provides a tidy R interface for modeling and forecasting univariate time series using
   Echo State Networks (ESNs). The model works within the fable framework provided by the fabletools package, which
   provides the tools to evaluate, visualise, and combine models in a workflow consistent with the tidyverse.
